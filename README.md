# GenAI RAG Engine

A modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine for building enterprise AI assistants.

## About

GenAI RAG Engine is designed to simplify the creation of advanced AI applications. It supports the entire RAG pipeline, from document ingestion to answer generation, providing an extensible architecture for chatbots, knowledge bases, and AI copilots.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Seamlessly import data from various sources.
- **Chunking**: Intelligent text splitting for optimal retrieval.
- **Embeddings**: Integration with state-of-the-art embedding models.
- **Vector Search**: Efficient similarity search for relevant context.
- **LLM-Based Answer Generation**: Generate accurate responses using Large Language Models.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Built-in metrics to assess performance.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to customize and extend for specific use cases.
